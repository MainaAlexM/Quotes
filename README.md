# Quotes
This is a Quotes-maker application that displays custom quotes posted by the author and allows the users customize and post their quotes. The interface is simple, with basic functionality, and a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0. HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla Javascript, and Typescript were utilized to build this application. Besides the design, I was glad learning how to navigate the angular cli and file system while designing this app.
