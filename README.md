# Quotes
This is application displays custom quotes posted by the author and allows the users customize and post their quotes. The interface is simple, with basic functionality, and a seamless user experience.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0. Besides the design, I was glad learning how to navigate the angular cli and file system while designing this app.

## Author
This application was a solo project, developed as a learning tool by Alex Maina, through his Software Engineering courswork at Moringa School.

## Usage
The author is glad that any interested developer can use his code to advance it further or propose pull requests for improvements. One can find this app on github pages via [this Link](https://mathenge-alex.github.io/Quotes/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
